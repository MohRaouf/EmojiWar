Once upon a time, there was a devil soul who tried to spread frustration and sadness between mankind, when humans realized the danger they sent 3 of their most prim worriers to fight for them, the worriers were so proud to be chosen for this holy mission, they geared up with their favorite weapons and started the journey to devil soul nests, there were 3 nests they need to take them down, so they greeted each other and got separated, one worrier for one nest, but they need help from you as a player to guide them in this fight.
